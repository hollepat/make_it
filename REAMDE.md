# MakeIt [work in progress]

Purpose of this project is to create a simple application, which allows a user to create a training program of any sort.

Let's I want to run a marathon.. -> I need to set up a plan of workouts that will get me there (the training period can be week or 10 days -> depends??).

In other words i want to have a application. That I can host and access with my phone. To manage what day I will go for a run/boulder/do my gym workout... etc. -> I have a lot of sports that I like, but I need to manage them..

## Secondary goal -> nothing to do with sport.

I want to take this opportunity to try to create a simple app, that I can deploy and use myself and my friends.

The key takeways to learn here:

1. Building a web app (with native suuport) -> deploying..
2. User Registration and Authentication
3. Integration of data from Apple Watches -> allow tracking how well the training was achieved.
