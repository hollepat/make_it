# Outline of the project MakeIt

Here I will write my ideas and comments for improvement.

- [x] Add option to delete session
- [x] Focus back on the programs - the programs shoudl have some goal and tag. the specific sessions will be then tagged, which will specify to which program it belongs to.


- [ ] Adding PersonalAgent to optimize training sessions and long term programs
    - Phase 1. integrate Agent to create a program with session + comments from a prompt/chat
    - Phase 2. integrate knowledge base about the user
    - Phase 3. integrate a DB of studies focused on training/sports


- [ ] Create a digital twin/ description of the user -- only necessary information -> agent should consider a random person

- [ ] Redesign the add view.
- [ ] Add option to edit the created events - assigne them to programs by giving them label that they are part of a program.
