# Outline of the project MakeIt

Here I will write my ideas and comments for improvement.

- [x] Add option to delete session
- [x] Focus back on the programs - the programs shoudl have some goal and tag. the specific sessions will be then tagged, which will specify to which program it belongs to.
- [ ] Adding PersonalAgent to optimize training sessions and long term programs
- [ ] Add a option to create an event in the calendar view, just like in any other
- [ ] Add option to edit the created events - assigne them to programs by giving them label that they are part of a program.
